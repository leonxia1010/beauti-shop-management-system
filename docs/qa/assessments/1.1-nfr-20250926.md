# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Secrets management and hardcoded credentials in examples
- Performance: CONCERNS - No performance targets defined for scaffolding
- Reliability: PASS - Health checks, error handling patterns established
- Maintainability: PASS - Excellent tooling setup and code structure

## Critical Issues

1. **Hardcoded credentials in examples** (Security)

   - Risk: Default passwords in .env.example could be used in production
   - Fix: Add clear warnings and require credential changes during setup
   - Location: `.env.example` has default postgres/redis passwords

2. **No performance targets defined** (Performance)
   - Risk: No baseline for future performance validation
   - Fix: Define response time targets in architecture docs
   - Note: This is scaffolding, but targets needed for subsequent stories

## Quick Wins

- Add prominent warnings to .env.example about changing default credentials: ~15 minutes
- Document performance targets in architecture: ~30 minutes
- Add security linting rules for credential detection: ~1 hour

## Positive Findings

### Security

- ✅ JWT authentication framework prepared
- ✅ CORS configuration present
- ✅ Bcrypt for password hashing configured
- ✅ AWS Secrets Manager integration planned

### Reliability

- ✅ Health checks implemented for database and Redis
- ✅ Docker health check configurations
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker builds for production

### Maintainability

- ✅ Excellent test coverage setup (Vitest, React Testing Library, Jest)
- ✅ Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, lint-staged)
- ✅ Clear project structure with shared libraries
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ Comprehensive CI/CD with automated quality gates

### Performance Infrastructure

- ✅ Redis caching infrastructure ready
- ✅ Connection pooling preparation in configuration
- ✅ CDN-ready asset structure

## Recommendations for Next Stories

1. **Security**: Implement rate limiting and input validation
2. **Performance**: Define and implement SLA targets
3. **Reliability**: Add circuit breakers and retry policies
4. **Maintainability**: Target 80%+ test coverage for business logic

## Assessment Context

This is infrastructure scaffolding, so many NFRs will be implemented in subsequent stories. The foundation is solid with good patterns established.
