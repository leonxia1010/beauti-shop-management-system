# Story 1.1: Monorepo Baseline Setup

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** platform engineer supporting the AI delivery team,
**I want** to bootstrap the monorepo with all primary apps, libraries, and automation scaffolding,
**so that** subsequent stories can focus on business features without reworking foundational tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo is created with Nx and npm, containing apps `admin-web`, `mobile-app`, `api-gateway`, and `batch-jobs`, each scaffolded with the correct framework/tooling described in the architecture. (Epic 1 scope)
2. Shared libraries `libs/domain`, `libs/ui`, `libs/data-access`, `libs/auth`, and `libs/infra` exist with path aliases, lint configuration, and initial placeholder exports to enable cross-app imports. (Epic 1 scope)
3. Root tooling is configured with ESLint, Prettier, and lint-staged, centralized under `tools/config`, and npm scripts for `lint`, `test`, `build`, and `format` execute successfully across all apps. (Epic 1 scope)
4. Local development environment includes a `docker-compose` definition launching NestJS API, PostgreSQL, Redis, and admin web static assets, matching the architecture‚Äôs development topology. (Epic 1 scope)
5. Continuous integration pipeline (GitHub Actions) builds the workspace, runs lint/tests, and builds the Docker image in alignment with the deployment plan. (Epic 1 scope)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- No previous stories exist; this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Data Models

- This story does not implement domain data models; it establishes scaffolding only.

### API Specifications

- No endpoints are implemented here; ensure the NestJS project structure aligns with the service modules outlined for future stories. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-breakdown]

### Component Specifications

- Admin web must use Vite + React 19 + TypeScript with Tailwind + shadcn/ui foundations. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#admin-web-vite--react]
- Mobile app relies on Expo-managed React Native with shared design tokens and NativeBase theme. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#mobile-app-react-native--expo]

### File Locations

- Follow the prescribed monorepo layout under `apps/` and `libs/`, and keep infrastructure code within `infra/`. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]

### Testing Requirements

- Ensure `npm run test` covers Jest for backend and React Testing Library for frontend scaffolds; wire Playwright/Detox placeholders for later stories if provided through Nx generators. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-quality-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints

- Use Node 20-compatible toolchain and ensure `ConfigService` pattern is respected when wiring placeholders. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#runtime-component-stack]
- Apply coding standards: enforced linting, reuse libs for shared logic, and prohibit direct `process.env` access outside config modules. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards-critical.md#coding-standards-critical]

### Security & Operations Notes

- Compose file should expose services within a local network matching private subnet assumptions; include comments about Secrets Manager parity. [Source: docs/architecture/architecture-part3.md#deployment--devops]
- CI pipeline must prepare Docker image build consistent with multi-stage Dockerfile approach. [Source: docs/architecture/architecture-part3.md#deployment--devops]

### Project Structure Notes

- Align Nx target naming with future automation (`build`, `serve`, `test`) and ensure Storybook/MSW integration hooks are stubbed for later. [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#devex--tooling]

### Dependencies & Follow-ups

- Subsequent stories will populate domain models, API endpoints, and UI flows once scaffolding is complete.

## Testing

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- `docker compose up --build` (verify NestJS API, Postgres, Redis services start successfully)
