  === SECOND REVIEW OBSERVATIONS (2025-09-30 17:00) ===

  IMPROVEMENTS VALIDATED:
  - ✅ DI configuration fixed: Added PrismaModule, AuditModule, ExceptionDetectionModule to revenue and costs modules
  - ✅ Repository pattern skeleton created with high code quality (transaction support, clean abstraction)
  - ✅ Professional documentation: TODO → NOTE conversion with clear story references
  - ✅ E2E test fixtures created (valid, invalid, performance test data)
  - ✅ Test infrastructure improving: 95% failure → 56% failure (42% improvement)

  POSITIVE TRENDS:
  - Developer demonstrated system-level thinking (fixed root cause, not symptoms)
  - Architecture decisions are pragmatic (skeleton vs rushed refactor)
  - Technical debt tracking is professional (NOTE comments with story links)
  - Team has clear roadmap for remaining issues (Story 1.3, 1.5)

  REMAINING CONCERNS (ALL WITH CLEAR PLANS):
  - Authentication/authorization deferred to Story 1.3 (acceptable with team confirmation)
  - 56% test failure rate needs continued attention
  - Repository pattern not yet in use (skeleton exists, migration planned Story 1.5)
  - Audit logs still use 'system' (blocked by Story 1.3 authentication)

  ARCHITECTURAL QUALITY:
  - NestJS dependency injection now correctly configured
  - Service layer separation maintained
  - Repository abstraction demonstrates good taste (Linus would approve)
  - Business logic well-encapsulated

  CODE QUALITY:
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance maintained
  - No 'any' type usage
  - Error handling consistent
  - Documentation improved with NOTE comments

  === ORIGINAL REVIEW OBSERVATIONS (2025-09-30 15:15) ===

  POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS:
  - Excellent domain modeling with Zod schemas providing runtime validation
  - Good separation of concerns: controller → service → database layers
  - Comprehensive exception detection system with configurable rules
  - Business rule engine properly abstracted for revenue share calculation
  - CSV parser handles both CSV and Excel formats with proper date coercion
  - Proper use of Prisma transactions for bulk operations
  - Detailed logging throughout service operations
  - Well-structured DTOs with class-validator decorators

  === SECOND REVIEW (2025-09-30 17:00) ===

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  - ✅ Test pass rate: 5% → 44% (39 percentage point improvement)
  - ✅ DI issues resolved in test setup
  - ✅ E2E fixtures created and available
  - ⚠️ 59 tests still failing (down from 101)

  UNIT TESTS:
  - ✓ Domain schema validation tests passing (32/32 - unchanged)
  - ⚠️ Service layer tests partially passing (DI fixed, some API assumptions wrong)
  - ⚠️ Controller tests improving but still have gaps

  INTEGRATION TESTS:
  - ⚠️ API endpoint tests partially working (DI fixed)
  - ⚠️ Missing /api/v1/revenue/validate endpoint causes test failures
  - ✓ Database connection working
  - ✓ Transaction handling verified in passing tests

  E2E TESTS:
  - ✅ Fixture files now exist (valid, invalid, performance data)
  - ⚠️ E2E tests need authentication system to run fully
  - ⚠️ User journey testing incomplete (blocked by auth)

  REMAINING GAPS:
  - Exception detection service (partial coverage)
  - CSV parser error paths (needs more scenarios)
  - Authorization logic (waiting for Story 1.3)
  - Full audit logging validation (waiting for user context from Story 1.3)
